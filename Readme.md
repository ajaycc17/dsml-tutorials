# Data Science and Machine Learning

Data Science and Machine Learning was taught as DSE302/ECS308 in my 6th semester in IISER Bhopal i.e. in 2020-21 II. It consists of basic tutorials of various data science and machine learning libraries in Python and a few basic problems with synthetic datasets. It also includes tutorials taught and projects developed under Advanced Programming in Python (DSE309) in IISERB in 2021-22 I.

## Run on Linux/Windows Terminal

Make sure the jupyter notebook, libraries and all the modules are install with the latest version of Python. I used Jupyter notebook in VSCode as the code editor.
