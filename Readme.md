Data Science and Machine Learning. It was taught under DSE302/ECS308 in the 6th semester in IISER Bhopal (2020-21). It consists basic tutorials of various data science and machine learning libraries in Python and a few basic problems with synthetic datasets.

## Run on Linux/Windows Terminal

Make sure the jupyter notebook, libraries and all the modules are install with the latest version of Python. I used Jupyter notebook in VSCode as the code editor.
